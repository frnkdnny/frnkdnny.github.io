description: The Rush Lacrosse team has gained a reputation in the National Lacrosse League for their edge and high impact play. I was approached by their marketing team to help reinforce their brand image through their website and give them a major facelift. The goal was to build high-impact visuals with a sense of legendary photo treatments. The website was a huge improvement from the digital tools they had in the past. It was awesome partnering with such a great team, building onto a brand with such and introducing them to an online solution for their organization.
