description: I was proud to volunteer in the 2014 Overnight Website Challenge, a 24-hour hackathon creating websites for non-profit organizations who may not otherwise have the money to afford. My team was paired with the Dragon Divas, a group of breast-cancer surviving women striving to demonstrate a full and active life following diagnosis through dragon boat racing. I was Lead Designer and Art Director on the project where our contributions to the finished site helped establish an online presence for these strong women.
