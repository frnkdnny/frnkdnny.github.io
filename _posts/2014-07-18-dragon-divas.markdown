description: I was proud to volunteer and participate in the 2014 Overnight Website Challenge, a 24-hour hackathon to create websites for non-profit organizations who may not otherwise have the resources to have one. My team was paired with the Dragon Divas, a group of strong breast-cancer surviving women striving to demonstrate a full and active life following diagnosis through dragon boat racing. I was the Lead Designer and Art Director on the front end development where our contributions to the finished site helped establish the courage and life of the Dragon Divas.
